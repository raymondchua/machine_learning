# Machine learning tutorials using C++

I am starting a collection of tutorials based on some of the most common Machine Learning algorithms. 

# Why am I using C++? 
I understand that using Python will make my life easier. But I wish to gain my experience in C++ as I am using Python daily for my work.


# Topics
1. Linear Regression 
2. Logistic Regression

Feel free to contact me for any comments and feedback.
